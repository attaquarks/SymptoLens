# SymptoLens

SymptoLens is a modern web application built with React, Express, and TypeScript that provides advanced symptom analysis and medical assistance using AI technologies. It combines cutting-edge machine learning with structured medical reasoning to deliver accurate and contextually aware medical insights.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Multimodal AI Model â€“ Understanding Symptoms from Text and Images

#### Text Encoder
- Processes user's symptom descriptions using models like BERT/fine-tuned GPT on medical texts
- Extracts semantic meaning and medical context from textual inputs

#### Image Encoder
- Utilizes CNNs or Vision Transformers trained on medical imagery
- Extracts visual features from uploaded medical images

#### Fusion Module
- Merges text and image embeddings using advanced strategies like intermediate fusion
- Creates a unified representation of the user's condition

#### Prediction Layer
- Outputs a list of possible medical conditions
- Provides associated probabilities for each condition
- Ranks conditions based on confidence scores

### 2. Knowledge Base Reasoning Engine â€“ Medical Validation and Contextual Intelligence

#### Knowledge Base
- Integrates multiple medical knowledge sources:
  - SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine)
  - ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases)
  - Medical knowledge graphs
  - Epidemiological databases

#### Reasoning Engine
- Validates AI predictions through:
  - Cross-referencing with known medical facts
  - Demographic plausibility checks
- Refines and ranks conditions based on medical expertise

### ðŸ”„ Integrated Workflow

1. User Input Processing
   - Text and image inputs are analyzed by the AI model
   - Initial condition predictions are generated

2. Medical Validation
   - Knowledge Base Reasoning Engine reviews predictions
   - Medical plausibility is assessed
   - Contextual factors are considered

3. Final Output Generation
   - Refined diagnosis list
   - Contextual medical information
   - Responsible health guidance
